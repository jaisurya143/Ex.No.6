1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly, with numerous tools and APIs
available for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and data
analysis. Integrating multiple AI tools into a unified Python framework enables
developers to compare model performance and leverage the best outputs for
practical applications.
1.2 Objective
To develop a Python-based system that can interact with various AI tool APIs,
automate input processing, compare outputs, and generate actionable
insights based on those outputs.
1.3 Scope of the Project
This project focuses on text-based AI services including summarization,
sentiment analysis, and question-answering, integrating APIs from OpenAI,
Hugging Face, and Google Cloud AI.
2. Overview of AI Tools and APIs
2.1 OpenAI API
Offers state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4, capable of text
generation, summarization, and classification tasks.
Here's additional Python code covering more AI tasks using OpenAI, Hugging
Face, and Google Cloud APIs:
1. OpenAI GPT-4 Example (Text Completion)
import openai
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
def call_openai_text_completion(prompt):
 response = openai.Completion.create(
 model="text-davinci-003", # You can also use "gpt4" here
 prompt=prompt,
 max_tokens=100,
 temperature=0.7
 )
 return response.choices[0].text.strip()
2. Hugging Face Transformers Example (Sentiment Analysis)
from transformers import pipeline
# Sentiment analysis using Hugging Face
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
def call_huggingface_sentiment(text):
 result = sentiment_analyzer(text)
 return result[0]['label'], result[0]['score']
3. Google Cloud Natural Language API (Entity Recognition)
from google.cloud import language_v1
client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient()
def call_google_entity_recognition(text):
 document = language_v1.Document(content=text,
type_=language_v1.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT)
 response = client.analyze_entities(request={'document':
document})
 entities = [(entity.name, entity.type_) for entity in
response.entities]
 return entities
4. OpenAI GPT-4 Example (Translation)
import openai
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
def call_openai_translation(text, target_language="es"):
 prompt = f"Translate the following text to
{target_language}: {text}"
 response = openai.Completion.create(
 model="text-davinci-003", # You can also use "gpt4" here
 prompt=prompt,
 max_tokens=100,
 temperature=0.3
 )
 return response.choices[0].text.strip()
5. Hugging Face Transformers Example (Text Classification)
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
def call_huggingface_classification(text,
candidate_labels=["sports", "politics", "business",
"entertainment"]):
 result = classifier(text, candidate_labels)
 return result['labels'][0], result['scores'][0]
6. Google Cloud Vision API Example (Image Labeling)
from google.cloud import vision
from google.cloud.vision import types
client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
def call_google_vision(image_path):
 with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
 content = image_file.read()
 image = types.Image(content=content)
 response = client.label_detection(image=image)
 labels = [label.description for label in
response.label_annotations]
 return labels
7. OpenAI GPT-4 Example (Summarization with Few-Shot Learning)
import openai
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
def call_openai_few_shot_summarization(examples, new_input):
 prompt = "\n".join([f"Q: {ex[0]}\nA: {ex[1]}" for ex in
examples]) + f"\nQ: {new_input}\nA:"
 response = openai.Completion.create(
 model="gpt-4",
 prompt=prompt,
 max_tokens=150,
 temperature=0.5
 )
 return response.choices[0].text.strip()
8. Hugging Face Transformers Example (Text Generation)
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt-2")
def call_huggingface_text_generation(prompt,
max_length=100):
 generated_text = generator(prompt,
max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1)
 return generated_text[0]['generated_text']
These examples show various AI tasks, such as text completion, sentiment
analysis, entity recognition, translation, and image labeling, across multiple
AI tools. Let me know if you'd like additional functionality or integration for
specific use cases!
2.2 Hugging Face Transformers
Open-source hub for thousands of pre-trained models accessible via a
unified Transformers library. Provides flexibility for offline or online API-based
use.
2.3 Google Cloud AI
Includes Vertex AI for building, deploying, and scaling machine learning
models with API access for NLP and vision tasks.
2.4 Azure OpenAI
Microsoft’s integration of OpenAI into Azure cloud infrastructure, offering
similar capabilities to OpenAI's native API.
2.5 Other Tools Considered
Other APIs like IBM Watson and Anthropic Claude were explored but not
included in this implementation due to limited open access or overlapping
functionality.
